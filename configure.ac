# Enable optional maintainer mode (off by default)
dnl AM_MAINTAINER_MODE turns off automatic reconstruction of the build
dnl files if the source build files have changed. A developer will want
dnl those automatic reconstructions to happen so that changes to the
dnl build system are actually carried out. However, a user might not
dnl have the tools required to reconfigure and the need for
dnl reconstruction might be spurious if the last-modified date is set
dnl incorrectly on the build files.
dnl
dnl Passing the option [enable] to AM_MAINTAINER_MODE makes the
dnl non-reconstruction feature available, but only when turned on by
dnl passing the option â€“disable-maintainer-mode. This option is
dnl apparently useful to some package distributors.
